# 0. Abstract

`BeeHive` is a modular program of implementation in iOS , it absorbed the Spring Framework API service concept to avoid to directly coupling between modules.

## 0.1 The basic architecture

We can get to know the architecture of BeeHive from this picture.

![](https://img.alicdn.com/tps/TB1k5u6LpXXXXc2XpXXXXXXXXXX-1968-1462.png)

## 0.2 Core concepts

- Module: Modules are separated by different function, every module can communicate with other one through their own services.
- Service: Services are the interface of the specifically module.

## 0.3 Achieved characteristics

* Plug-in module development of the operating framework
* Module implementation and interface calls Separation
* manage module life loop， extend the application of system events

## 0.4 Design

`BeeHive` bases on `Spring` Service concept, although you can make and implement specific interfaces decoupling between modules , but can not avoid interface class dependencies.

Why not use invoke and dynamic link library technology for decoupling interface , similar to `Apache`'s `DSO` way?

Mainly on account of the difficulty and cost of learning to achieve , and dynamic invocation interface parameters can not be able to check phase change problems at compile time , dynamic programming techniques require a higher threshold requirement.

## 0.5 Project name origin

`BeeHive` inspired by the honeycomb. `Honeycomb` is the world's highly modular engineering structures, hexagonal design can bring unlimited expansion possibilities. So we used to do for this project BeeHive named.

# 1. Module life-cycle event

BeeHive's Each module will provide life-cycle events for the host environment and Each module necessary information exchange to BeeHive, you can observer the change in life run loop.

Events are divided into three types:

* System Event
* Universal Event
* Business Custom Event

## 1.1 System Event

System events are usually Application life-cycle events , such as DidBecomeActive, WillEnterBackground etc.
System Event basic workflow is as follows:

![](https://img.alicdn.com/tps/TB1d_qQNFXXXXc3XVXXXXXXXXXX-1748-544.jpg)

## 1.2 Universal Event

On the basis of system events on the extended general application events , such modSetup, modInit , etc. , may be used to code each plug-in module initialization settings

Extended common events are as follows :

## 1.3 Business Custom Event

If you feel the system event , the event is not sufficient to meet the general needs , we will simplify the event packaged into BHAppdelgate, you can extend your own event by inheritance BHAppdelegate, while BHContext Lane modulesByName access each module entry class , to increase the trigger point through.

# 2. Module registration

Registration module divided into two types , static registration and dynamic registration

## 2.1 Static registration

![](http://gtms01.alicdn.com/tps/i1/TB114eDIFXXXXcdaXXX6VsMLVXX-998-334.png_400x400.jpg)

## 2.2 Dynamic registration

Use `BH_EXPORT_MODULE` macro module entry in the class implementation  declares the class for the
implementation class entry module

```
@implementation HomeModule

BH_EXPORT_MODULE(YES)

-(void)modInit:(BHContext *)context;

@end
```

## 2.3 Asynchronous loading

If the module is set to export BH_EXPORT_MODULE (YES), it will initialize asynchronous execution module can be optimized before starting after the first screen shows the contents of the start time consuming

# 3. Programming

`BHModuleProtocol` provides various modules each module can hook functions , and logic for implementing the plug-in code, you can fine protocol in `BHModuleProtocol.h`.

## 3.1 Setting environment variables

By context.env we can judge our application environment state to decide how we configure our application

```objc
-(void)modSetup:(BHContext *)context
{
	switch (context.env) {
		case BHEnvironmentDev:
		break;
		case BHEnvironmentProd:
		default:
		break;
	}
}
```


## 3.2 Module Init

If the module there is need to start initialization logic can modInit in the preparation of , for example, the module can register an external module interface to access the Service

```objc
-(void)modInit:(BHContext *)context
{
	[[BeeHive shareInstance] registerService:@protocol(UserTrackServiceProtocol) service:[BHUserTrackViewController class]];
}
```

## 3.3 Event processing systems

Event system will be passed to each module, so that each module to decide to write business logic.


```objc
-(void)modQuickAction:(BHContext *)context
{
	[self process:context.shortcutItem handler:context.scompletionHandler];
}
```

## 3.4 Inter-modal calls

Event prepared by treating the various business modules can plug-in programming , it has no dependencies between the various business modules , through the interaction between the core and the event module, to achieve a plug-in isolation . But sometimes we need to call each other between modules some collaborative features to completion.

Usually in the form of three types to access service:

1. by interface(like `Spring`)
2. by `Export Method`(like `PHP`/`ReactNatve` extension)
3. by `URL Route` pattern(like interaction between iPhone apps)

Interface type of service access can take the advantages of compile-time checking is found to change the interface , so that timely correction interface issues . The disadvantage is the need to rely on the interface definition header file by the module increases the more the maintenance interface definition there is a certain amount of work .

### 3.4.1 Declare service interface

Case thought HomeServiceProtocol:

```
@protocol HomeServiceProtocol <NSObject, BHServiceProtocol>

-(void)registerViewController:(UIViewController *)vc title:(NSString *)title iconName:(NSString *)iconName;

@end
```

### 3.4.2 Register Service

There are three ways to register ViewController Service.

#### Declarative registration

```objc
@implementation HomeService

BH_EXPORT_SERVICE()

@end
```

#### API registration

```objc
[[BeeHive shareInstance] registerService:@protocol(HomeServiceProtocol) service:[BHViewController class]];
```

#### `BHService.plist` registration

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
	<dict>
		<key>HomeServiceProtocol</key>
		<string>BHViewController</string>
	</dict>
</plist>

```

### 3.4.3 Service invocation

```objc
#import "BHService.h"

id< HomeServiceProtocol > homeVc = [[BeeHive shareInstance] createService:@protocol(HomeServiceProtocol)];

// use homeVc do invocation
```

## 3.5 Singleton or several instance

For some scenes , we visit each declared as service objects , objects can hope to retain some of the state , then we need to declare this service object is a singleton object .

We only need to implement the function declaration in the event service objects

```objc
-(BOOL) singleton
{
	return YES;
}
```

The object was acquired by createService singleton object , if the function returns to achieve the above is NO, createService returns multiple cases

```objc
id< HomeServiceProtocol > homeVc = [[BeeHive shareInstance] createService:@protocol(HomeServiceProtocol)];
```

## 3.6 Global Context

Initial setup application project information , and share information across applications among modules

```objc
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions
{
	[BHContext shareInstance].env ＝ BHEnvironmentDev;

	[BHContext shareInstance].application = application;
	[BHContext shareInstance].launchOptions = launchOptions;

	[BHContext shareInstance].moduleConfigName = @"BeeHive.bundle/CustomModulePlist";
	[BHContext shareInstance].serviceConfigName =  @"BeeHive.bundle/CustomServicePlist";

	[BHContext shareInstance].appkey  = xxxxxx;
	[BHContext shareInstance].Mtopkey  = xxxxx;


	[[BeeHive shareInstance] setContext:[BHContext shareInstance]];

	[super application:application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:launchOptions];


	id<HomeServiceProtocol> homeVc = [[BeeHive shareInstance] createService:@protocol(HomeServiceProtocol)];


	if ([homeVc isKindOfClass:[UIViewController class]]) {
		UINavigationController *navCtrl = [[UINavigationController alloc] initWithRootViewController:(UIViewController*)homeVc];

		self.window = [[UIWindow alloc] initWithFrame:[UIScreen mainScreen].bounds];
		self.window.rootViewController = navCtrl;

		[self.window makeKeyAndVisible];
	}

	return YES;
}
```
